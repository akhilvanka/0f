A simple flask app that proxies websites with the added benefit of removing the paywall (using some random tricks)




## Features

- Maintains the original JS as long as it doesn't cause the paywall
- Original site design, images, and even embeded links maintain
- Simple/minimal




## FAQ
#### Does this store any information?

Nope

#### What websites does this work on?

Honestly, there's so many news sources that I haven't had the time to try them all. I can say that the NYT, FT, WP, and Economist all work with minimal hiccups. The WSJ only works through a redirect, which also requires the browser to be in Incognito.
